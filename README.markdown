# Twitty Twister

Twitty twister allows you to access twitter-compatible APIs from pure twisted
apps. It supports standard and OAuth authentication.

See the [example/](/dustin/twitty-twister/tree/master/example/) directory
for example commandline tools that exercise various parts of the API.

## What are People Saying About It?

Not much, but I consider this an excellent review:

> A winning project name if ever I've read one.
